Create a program that has three options


WELCOME TO MUZAK

1. Insert a new album
2. Search for an album
3. QUIT


Run the menu in a loop and continue asking for input unless the user has entered 3. If the user enters anything that is not a 1, 2, or 3 print an error message.

When inserting an album, write it to a text file.

When searching for an album, read from the text file and see if you can locate it.

When QUIT, well, quit.



Start out first by getting the menu going and writing to a text file. It can be complicated, but you can figure it out.
